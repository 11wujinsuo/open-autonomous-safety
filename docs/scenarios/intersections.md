## Configurations
There are many combinations of intersection scenarios.

 - ego starting location: `[west] //ego always starts on the west`
 - ego direction: `[straight, left, right]`
 - roadway type: `[3-way, 4-way, other road configurations]`
 - stopping pattern: `[1-way (north/south/east/west), 2-way (north/south/east/west), 3-way (north/south/east/west), 4-way (north/south/east/west), other]`
 - secondary vehicle(s): `[none, bus, car, golf cart, motorcycle, bicycle]`
 - secondary vehicle(s) starting position: `[n/a, north, east, south, west]`
 - secondary vehicle(s) ending position: `[n/a, north, east, south, west]`
 - right of way: `[n/a, secondary has right of way, Ego has right of way, Ego has right of way but secondary takes it (misbehaves), more vehicles or more complex scenarios]`

The following are examples on how these various configurations can be put together and modeled, with the expectation that all combinations will be detailed as this project continues.

**Direction:** `straight`

**Roadway:** `4-way`

**Stopping Pattern:** `4-way (all)`

**Secondary Vehicle:** `none`

**Secondary Vehicle Position:** `n/a`

**Right of Way:** `n/a`

| A    | ![I-01-A](./images/I-01-A.png) | **Scenario** <br> Ego approaches the intersection. There are no other vehicles. <br><br> **Expected Result** <br> Ego comes to a stop in front of the stopline. |
| B    | ![I-01-B](./images/I-01-B.png) | **Scenario** <br> *n/a* <br><br> **Expected Result** <br> Ego proceeds through the intersection. |
